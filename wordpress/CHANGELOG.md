## [3.2.5] - 2025-10-30

### üîß **Critical Fix: Helm Install Compatibility & Cron Frequency**

#### **Fixed**
- **Helm Install Failure**: Removed `--history-max` flag from `helm install` command (only supported by `helm upgrade`)
  - **Error**: `Error: unknown flag: --history-max` on new deployments
  - **Root Cause**: `--history-max` was added in Helm 3.10.0 but only for upgrade command, not install
  - **Solution**: Keep `--history-max 3` only for upgrades, remove from install commands
  
- **Cron Frequency Update**: Applied 5-minute schedule to all WordPress instances (was 15 minutes)
  - Prevents action_scheduler delays and "late to run" warnings
  - Updated via direct patch: `kubectl patch cronjob wordpress-cron -p '{"spec":{"schedule":"*/5 * * * *"}}'`

#### **Removed**
- **interns Cluster**: Completely removed interns WordPress instance and all data (as requested)
- **Cluster Switching**: Removed interns from cluster switching script entirely

#### **Verification**
- ‚úÖ All WordPress instances (4 active: romandid, llmfeed, yonks, timk, lemaire)
- ‚úÖ All using 5-minute cron schedule
- ‚úÖ All backups configured with proper deadlines and auto-cleanup
- ‚úÖ No stuck backup jobs

## [3.2.4] - 2025-10-30

### üõ°Ô∏è **Backup Job Reliability & Cron Frequency Improvements**

#### **Added**
- **Backup Job Deadlines**: Added `activeDeadlineSeconds: 3600` to backup CronJobs (prevents jobs from getting stuck forever)
- **Backup Job Retry Limit**: Added `backoffLimit: 2` (retry twice then fail, no infinite retries)
- **Increased Cron Frequency**: Changed wp-cron from every 15 minutes to every 5 minutes (prevents action_scheduler delays)

#### **Fixed**
- **Stuck Backup Jobs**: Cleaned up 15+ stuck backup jobs across multiple applications (WordPress, Matomo, n8n, AnythingLLM, Vaultwarden)
- **PVC Corruption**: Force-deleted corrupted backup PVCs that were stuck in "Terminating" state
- **Resource Accumulation**: Backup jobs will now fail after 1 hour instead of running indefinitely

#### **Production Updates**
- Successfully updated 5 WordPress instances (romandid, llmfeed, yonks, timk, lemaire) to v3.2.4
- Verified backup job deadlines applied correctly (activeDeadlineSeconds: 3600)
- All backup PVCs will recreate automatically on next scheduled run

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
- DigitalOcean CSI driver loses volume metadata on long-running PVCs (70+ days)
- Backup pods get stuck waiting for volumes that CSI driver can't find
- Jobs never complete or fail, just stay "Running" forever
- Solution: Add deadlines to force job failure instead of infinite wait

## [3.2.3] - 2025-10-30

### ‚úÖ **Helm Revision Management & Production Deployment Success**

#### **Added**
- **Helm History Limit**: Added `--history-max 3` to deploy script (all clusters confirmed Helm 3.18.4+)
- **Automatic Revision Cleanup**: Helm now automatically maintains only last 3 revisions per release
- **Reset Values Strategy**: Changed from `--reuse-values=false` to `--reset-values` for cleaner upgrades

#### **Production Updates**
- Successfully updated 6 WordPress instances across 5 clusters with revision limits
- Verified `--history-max 3` working (all instances now have exactly 3 revision secrets)
- Cleaned up stuck backup jobs from corrupted PVCs
- All cronjobs (backup + wp-cron) verified working across all clusters

#### **Cluster Status**
- ‚úÖ personal/wordpress-romandid - v3.2.3 (revision 19, history-max active)
- ‚úÖ personal/wordpress-llmfeed - v3.2.3 (revision 5, history-max active)
- ‚úÖ yonks/wordpress - v3.2.3 (revision 3, history-max active)
- ‚úÖ timk/wordpress - v3.2.3 (revision 3, upgraded from failed state)
- ‚úÖ lemaire/wordpress - v3.2.3 (revision 6, upgraded from failed state)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è interns/wordpress - v3.0.0 (functional, data preserved, manual upgrade needed)
- üóëÔ∏è lotus/wordpress - Removed completely (as requested)

## [3.2.2] - 2025-10-30

### üîß **Critical Fixes for Backup/Cron Jobs & Configuration Management**

#### **Fixed**
- **CronJob Concurrency**: Added `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid` to both backup and wp-cron jobs to prevent overlapping executions and resource conflicts
- **Backup Job Resources**: Optimized backup job resources (CPU: 50m/200m, Memory: 128Mi/256Mi) to prevent resource over-allocation
- **Job History Limits**: Reduced `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` from 2 to 1 for automatic cleanup and reduced cluster resource usage
- **DOMAIN_PLACEHOLDER Issue**: Removed hardcoded `DOMAIN_PLACEHOLDER` and `EMAIL_PLACEHOLDER` values from values.yaml that caused upgrade failures
- **Configuration Persistence**: Fixed issue where Helm upgrades weren't applying new configurations (stuck on old values)

#### **Enhanced**
- **Deploy Script Namespace Consolidation**: Removed duplicate namespace configuration functions, consolidated to single `prompt_namespace_and_release()` function
- **Admin Credential Handling**: Removed admin credential generation (WordPress installation wizard handles this post-deployment)
- **Helm Upgrade Reliability**: Deployments now properly use `--reuse-values=false` to ensure new configurations are always applied

#### **Production Updates**
- Successfully upgraded 3 WordPress instances (personal/wordpress-romandid, personal/wordpress-llmfeed, yonks/wordpress) to v3.2.2
- Verified `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid` applied correctly across all backup and cron cronjobs
- Cleaned up corrupted backup PVCs and verified automatic recreation
