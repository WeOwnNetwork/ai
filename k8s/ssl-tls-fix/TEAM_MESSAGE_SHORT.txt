SSL/TLS fix is complete ✅

US user's issue is DNS propagation delay, not SSL. Their ISP DNS hasn't updated yet.

Why it works on VPN/cellular but not WiFi:
- VPN uses Google/Cloudflare DNS (already updated)
- Different ISPs = different DNS servers

Quick fix: Change DNS to Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). Works immediately.

Will auto-resolve in 24-48 hours as ISP DNS updates. No action needed on our side.
