- **curl** - HTTP client for downloads
- **git** - Version control (for cloning)
- **openssl** - Cryptographic toolkit

**Required Infrastructure:**
- **Kubernetes cluster** (DigitalOcean Kubernetes recommended)
- **Domain name** with DNS management access
- **Email address** for SSL certificates

**Cluster Requirements:**
- Minimum 2 nodes with 4GB RAM each
- NGINX Ingress Controller installed

### One-Command Deployment

```bash
# Clone and deploy in one command
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WeOwnNetwork/ai/main/MVP-0.1/anythingllm/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeOwnNetwork/ai.git
cd ai/MVP-0.1/anythingllm

# Run the enhanced deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

## 🔧 Enhanced Deployment Script v3.0.0

The deployment script has been completely rewritten with enterprise-grade features:

### ✅ **Robust Error Handling**
- **Auto-resume capability**: Script saves state and continues from where it left off
- **Automatic prerequisite installation**: Installs missing tools (kubectl, helm, etc.) automatically
- **Full logging**: All operations logged with timestamps for complete transparency
- **No more manual restarts**: Handles all installations without user intervention

### 🔐 **Admin Credentials Explained**
The script generates admin credentials that serve **three purposes**:

1. **System Authentication**: Used for API access and system integrations
2. **Emergency Access**: Backup admin access if needed
3. **Kubernetes Secrets**: Stored securely in cluster secrets

**Important**: These credentials are **NOT** automatically used for web interface login. You must:
- Access your deployed instance web interface
- Enable "Multi-User Mode" first (CRITICAL for security)
- Manually create your web admin account (can use same or different credentials)

### 🌐 **DNS & TTL Configuration**
- **Testing/Demo**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) - Good for rapid changes during setup
- **Production**: 3600 seconds (1 hour) - Better for stability and caching
- **Team Usage**: Keep 300s during onboarding, increase to 3600s when stable

### 🔄 **Updates & Maintenance**

#### **Updates**
- **Manual Updates**: Re-run the deployment script (`./deploy.sh`)
- **Strategy**: Rolling updates with zero downtime
- **Check Status**: `helm list -n anything-llm`
- **Automatic Updates**: Not enabled by default (recommended for stability)

#### **Backups**
- **Data Location**: Persistent volume at `/app/server/storage`
- **Method**: DigitalOcean volume snapshots (recommended)
- **Manual Backup**: Use `kubectl cp` commands for critical data
- **Automation**: Set up daily snapshots via DigitalOcean control panel

#### **Scaling**

**Pod Scaling** (for more concurrent users):
```bash
# Scale to 2 replicas for higher availability
kubectl scale deployment anythingllm -n anything-llm --replicas=2

# Monitor resource usage
kubectl top pods -n anything-llm
```

**Node Scaling** (for larger AI models):
```bash
# Scale cluster nodes via DigitalOcean control panel or:
doctl kubernetes cluster node-pool resize <cluster-id> <node-pool-id> --count 3

# For GPU workloads (future LLM-D integration)
# Add GPU-enabled node pools for local model hosting
```

**Resource Optimization for Large Models**:
- **Memory**: Increase to 8Gi+ for large models in `values.yaml`
- **CPU**: 2-4 cores recommended for optimal performance
- **Storage**: 50Gi+ for model caching and user data
- **GPU**: Required for local LLM hosting (LLM-D integration)

## 🔐 **Enterprise Security Features**

### **Zero-Trust Networking**
AnythingLLM includes a comprehensive NetworkPolicy that implements zero-trust networking:

**Ingress Security** (Who can connect TO AnythingLLM):
- ✅ **NGINX Ingress Controller only** - Web traffic from authenticated users
- ✅ **Same namespace services** - Internal Kubernetes communication
- ❌ **All other pods/namespaces** - Blocked by default

**Egress Security** (What AnythingLLM can connect TO):
- ✅ **DNS resolution** - Required for domain lookups
- ✅ **HTTPS (port 443)** - LLM API calls (OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.)
- ✅ **HTTP (port 80)** - Some APIs that don't use HTTPS
- ❌ **All other outbound traffic** - Blocked by default

### **TLS Certificate Management**
- **Automatic issuance**: Let's Encrypt certificates via cert-manager
- **Auto-renewal**: Certificates renew 30 days before expiry
- **Zero downtime**: Renewal process doesn't interrupt service
- **Enterprise-grade**: TLS 1.3 encryption for all traffic

### **Pod Security**
- **Non-root containers**: All processes run as non-privileged user
- **Read-only filesystem**: Prevents runtime modifications
- **Resource limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Health checks**: Automatic restart if pod becomes unhealthy

### **Secrets Management**
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **No plain text**: Admin credentials, JWT secrets, API keys secured
- **Least privilege**: Service accounts with minimal required permissions

## 📋 Deployment Process

The deployment script (`deploy.sh`) provides a fully interactive, guided experience with complete transparency:

### **What the Script Does Automatically**
1. **Prerequisites Check**: Verifies kubectl, helm, curl, git, openssl are installed

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: LLM provider API key (if configured)
- `OPENAI_API_BASE`: LLM provider base URL (if configured)

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain
Update your DNS to point to the cluster load balancer:
```
Type: A
Name: your-subdomain
Value: [Load Balancer IP from deployment]
TTL: 300
```

### Network Policies
For enhanced security, the deployment includes network policies that:
- Allow ingress traffic only from NGINX Ingress Controller
- Restrict pod-to-pod communication
- Block unauthorized external access

### Monitoring and Observability
Check deployment health:
```bash
# Pod status
kubectl get pods -n anything-llm

# View logs
kubectl logs -n anything-llm -l app.kubernetes.io/name=anythingllm -f

# Check ingress
kubectl get ingress -n anything-llm

# Certificate status
kubectl get certificate -n anything-llm
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Can't connect to cluster"**
- Verify kubectl is configured: `kubectl cluster-info`
- Check cluster access: `kubectl get nodes`
- For DigitalOcean: `doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <cluster-id>`

**"Pod stuck in Pending state"**
- Check resource availability: `kubectl describe nodes`
- Verify storage class exists: `kubectl get storageclass`
- Check pod events: `kubectl describe pod -n anything-llm`

**"TLS certificate not issued"**
- Verify DNS is pointing to load balancer IP
- Check cert-manager logs: `kubectl logs -n cert-manager -l app=cert-manager`
- Verify ClusterIssuer: `kubectl get clusterissuer`

**"Can't access after enabling security"**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Use incognito/private browsing mode
- Verify admin credentials are correct

**"LLM not responding"**
- Check API key is valid and has credits
- Verify LLM provider configuration in Settings
- Try different models (some may be rate-limited)

### Getting Admin Credentials
If you lose access, retrieve credentials from Kubernetes:
```bash
# Get admin email
kubectl get secret anythingllm-secrets -n anything-llm -o jsonpath="{.data.ADMIN_EMAIL}" | base64 -d

# Get admin password
kubectl get secret anythingllm-secrets -n anything-llm -o jsonpath="{.data.ADMIN_PASSWORD}" | base64 -d
```

### Logs and Debugging
```bash
# Application logs
kubectl logs -n anything-llm deployment/anythingllm

# Ingress controller logs
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx

# cert-manager logs
kubectl logs -n cert-manager -l app=cert-manager
```
