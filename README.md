# ‚ôæÔ∏è WeOwn Cloud - Enterprise Kubernetes AI Infrastructure

üöÄ **WeOwn Cloud by WeOwn AI** - Production-grade Kubernetes platform delivering secure, scalable AI and automation services across distributed clusters.

## üåê **WeOwn Cloud Architecture**

WeOwn Cloud represents a **single-tenant, multi-cluster** infrastructure that transforms individual Kubernetes clusters into unified cloud environments. Each cluster runs the complete WeOwn application stack with enterprise-grade security, enabling teams to deploy AI, automation, and productivity tools with zero-trust networking and SOC2/ISO42001 compliance.

### **Core Concept: Single-Tenant Cloud**
Rather than traditional multi-tenant SaaS, WeOwn Cloud provides each organization with their **own dedicated cluster environment**:

- **Dedicated Resources**: No resource sharing between organizations
- **Data Sovereignty**: Complete control over data location and processing
- **Security Isolation**: Zero-trust networking with complete tenant isolation
- **Custom Configurations**: Tailored to specific organizational needs
- **Direct Kubernetes Access**: Full infrastructure control and transparency

## üìö **Enterprise Integration**

### **Multi-Cluster Cohort Model:**
WeOwn Cloud enables **cohort-based deployment** where each team or organization receives:

1. **Dedicated Cluster**: Full Kubernetes environment with enterprise security
2. **Standard Application Stack**: AI, automation, password management, CMS
3. **Custom Domain Configuration**: Professional subdomain structure
4. **Independent Data Sovereignty**: Complete control over data and processing
5. **Unified Management Tools**: Consistent deployment and monitoring across clusters

### **Scaling Strategies:**

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):**
- **WordPress**: Scale replicas based on CPU/memory usage
- **n8n**: Scale workflow execution pods for high throughput

**Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA):**
- **AnythingLLM**: Automatic memory adjustment for AI workloads
- **All Applications**: Learn usage patterns, optimize resource requests

**Cluster Scaling:**
- **Horizontal**: Add nodes for more total capacity
- **Vertical**: Upgrade node sizes for memory-intensive workloads
